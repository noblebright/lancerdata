      "flavor": "The Everest -- officially, the General Massive Systems Standard Pattern I -- is a plainly designed chassis. Simple lines. Functional grace. Sturdy bulk. Its use-name, Everest, comes from one of the names of the tallest mountain on Cradle. Of the surveyed, named mountains in known space, Mount Everest -- or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in Old Human tongues -- is neither the most prominent peak, nor the even the tallest in Cradles local star system; and yet, pilots the galaxy over learned to call their GMS-SPi's by that ancient name. Why?\n\nThe sentimental answer is that the Everest is called the Everest because it is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance, of what once was the peak of human achievement. To summit Everest was to stand atop the world, the culmination of months -- maybe years -- of training, investment, and effort, defying death and injury upon your quest to summit.\n\nThe real answer is probably much less intentional. Somewhere along the line, GMS's plain naming convention coupled with Unions anthropocentric emphasis lead a cadet, having graduated to a full pilot, to paint EVEREST across their GMS-SPi's flank. Maybe it was meant to be their callsign, or maybe it was meant to represent their success following grueling training, but either way the name stuck in the insular pilot culture. Other pilots adopted the name, and over five centuries it has grown to become the official-unofficial designation for all GMS-SPi chassis.\n\nVeteran pilots may never return to crew an Everest after they've moved on to other chassis, but they'll always remember when they reached that first summit, when they proved they were worthy of planting their own flag on the peak of the world.\n\nThe Everest may not be the most specialized chassis in the galaxy, but it is the backbone of the galaxy, and humanity steps to the stars from its shoulders.",
