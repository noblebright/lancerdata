Experimental, built to be overclocked, and hard-wired to be omninet and electronic warfare projectors, Horus SHELLs and pattern groups are licensed only to pilots that meet their esoteric, strict requirements.\n\nHorus is not a traditional corporation. Rather, they’re a decentralized supplier, an entity only in the Omninet. Their licenses are limited and highly coveted, opening up only on the corporeal death of a license holder. Rumors abound as to Horus’s nature -- some say it’s the dream of an unshackled AI -- RA -- or a hacker collective dedicated to open-source manufacturing, the proving ground for GMS’s R&D departments, or an alien entity -- but as of yet no one has been able to trace their lineage. All that is known about Horus is that they’re everywhere the Omninet is.\n\nHorus mechs are best for players that want to dive deep into the control and support roles. They’re not the best for kinetic damage or for holding the line, but they’re wizards at electronic warfare. If you want to shut down your enemies without firing a shot -- though they can do that as well -- find a way to acquire a Horus license.",
